# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Project

## Project Description
A Python-based data analysis project tracking COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across multiple countries. This project cleans real-world data from Our World in Data, performs exploratory analysis, and visualizes key trends using Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Objectives
1. Import and clean COVID-19 global dataset
2. Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
3. Compare metrics across countries/regions
4. Visualize trends with charts and maps
5. Generate actionable insights from the data

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.11
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
- **Core Libraries**:
  - pandas (data manipulation)
  - matplotlib/seaborn (visualization)
  - plotly (interactive charts)
- **Additional Tools**: Git/GitHub (version control)

## How to Run the Project
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Python 3.11+
   - Install required packages:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyter
     ```

2. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open the notebook in VS Code with Jupyter extension:
     ```
     code covid_analysis.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute cells sequentially (Ctrl+Enter)

3. **Alternative Viewing**:
   - View on GitHub (static render)
   - Open in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for better rendering
   - Launch in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Key Insights
1. **Vaccination Impact**: Countries with faster vaccine rollouts showed X% lower peak death rates
2. **Regional Patterns**: [Your observation about specific regions]
3. **Time Trends**: Case spikes correlated with [your finding about timing]

## Reflections
- Challenges faced: Handling missing data from different country reporting standards
- Lessons learned: Importance of data cleaning before analysis
- Future improvements: Add real-time data fetching capability
